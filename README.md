Application Instruction:
This should not be limited to the data that has been currently imported, but could be generalized to more data(however with similar formats) if you want. 
From viewing the map and being able to see/update/edit features of each squirrel, you could get a pretty clear insight about this cute little creature specifically around the New York Central Park area.
